# Simple Path Editor (WIP)

An editor that makes editting the PATH environment variable easier in
Linux. Entries can be added, removed, rearranged, and sorted. Duplicates can also
be removed. Path cannot be export as of now, but that's planned for later. The 
project is currently written in python with plans to maybe reimplement in C++.

Built using...

- Qt Designer
- Python 3.9 (other versions not tested)
- PyQt5

Run "make ui" to update the layout from Qt Designer.
